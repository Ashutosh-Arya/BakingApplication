	A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
	
	Types of databases:
		- Relational databases
			- way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns. An RDB has the ability to establish links—or relationships–between information by joining tables, 
			which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points.
			- used by organizations that need to manage large amounts of structured data, from tracking inventory to processing transactional data to application logging.  
		- Object-oriented databases
			- supports the modelling and creation of data as objects
			- An object-oriented database system must meet two requirements: it must be a database management system (DBMS) and it must be an object-oriented system, meaning that it must, to the greatest degree feasible.
			
		- Distributed databases
			- distributed database is a database that stores data in multiple locations instead of one location. This means that rather than putting all data on one server or on one computer,
			  data is placed on multiple servers or in a cluster of computers consisting of individual nodes. These nodes are oftentimes geographically separate and may be physical computers or
			  virtual machines within a cloud database.

		- NoSQL databases
			-  NoSQL databases, data can be stored without defining the schema upfront—which means you have the ability to get moving and iterate quickly, defining the data model as you go.
				This can be suitable for specific business requirements, whether it’s graph-based, column-oriented, document-oriented, or as a key-value store.
		- Graph databases
			- A graph database is a systematic collection of data that emphasizes the relationships between the different data entities. The NoSQL database uses mathematical graph theory to show data connections.
			  these databases often provide better performance and flexibility as they are more suited for modelling real-world scenarios.
		- Cloud databases
			- A cloud database is a database that is built, deployed, and accessed in a cloud environment, such as a private, public, or hybrid cloud.
		
		- Self-driving databases
			- An autonomous database is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by DBAs. 
			  autonomous database performs all these tasks and more without human intervention.
			  
		- Network Database
			-  represent data in a tree-like structure.
